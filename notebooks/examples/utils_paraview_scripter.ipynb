    "Paraview scripting could help the workflow of visualization a lot. It could:\n",
    "* Combine multiple visualization features (e.g. color plots, contours)\n",
    "* Automatically apply filters and initiate creative workflows (e.g. iso-volumes, calculator for new variable)\n",
    "* Make single plot reproducible\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this could be a pain to standarlize this workflow. The main challenges are:\n",
    "* Paraview uses its only executable \"pvpython\" or \"paraview --script\" to run the script, thus we have to save every to a script. It may contains a lot of variable to modify each time we run it.\n",
    "* It's syntax is not intuitive, you can only figure it out by tracing.\n"
