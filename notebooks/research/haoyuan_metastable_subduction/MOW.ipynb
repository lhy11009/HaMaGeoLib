    "They already include the latent heat release from the exthorthemic transition in the thermal model (Fig. 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Loading**:\n",
    "   - Reads the temperature profile from a CSV file (`kubo_2009_T_center.csv`).\n",
    "   - The file is located in the `data_set` directory within the specified `base_dir`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Extraction**:\n",
    "   - Extracts depth (in kilometers) and temperature (in degrees Celsius) columns from the loaded dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Interpolation**:\n",
    "   - Uses `scipy.interpolate.interp1d` to create an interpolation function for the temperature profile.\n",
    "   - Generates interpolated values for depths at 1 km intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Visualization**:\n",
    "   - Plots the interpolated temperature profile, with depth on the x-axis and temperature on the y-axis.\n",
    "   - Includes axis labels and a grid for improved clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions and Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- The CSV file must exist at the specified path, and its structure should include two columns: depth and temperature.\n",
    "- The depth values should be sorted in ascending order for proper interpolation."

    "### FIgure 5: Nucleation and Growth Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parameters**:\n",
    "   - Temperature (\\(T\\)) and pressure (\\(P\\)) profiles are calculated for depths from 400 km to 700 km.\n",
    "   - Grain sizes (\\(d\\)) are set to \\(5 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{m}\\) for grain-boundary nucleation and \\(5 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{m}\\) for intracrystalline nucleation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Growth Rates**:\n",
    "   - Growth rates are computed using metastable conditions for varying water concentrations (\\(C_{OH}\\)).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Transformed Volume Fractions**:\n",
    "   - The cumulative transformed volume (\\(V\\)) is calculated as:\n",
    "     \\[\n",
    "     V = 1 - \\exp(-2.0 \\cdot S \\cdot \\text{integral})\n",
    "     \\]\n",
    "   - \\(S\\) is the surface area per unit volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Plots**:\n",
    "   - **Grain-boundary nucleation**: \\(V\\) is plotted against depth for water concentrations of 250, 500, and 750 wt.ppm.\n",
    "   - **Intracrystalline nucleation**: \\(V\\) is plotted against depth for water concentrations of 50, 150, and 250 wt.ppm.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional Notes\n",
    "* They seem to not include the positive feedback from the latentheat, as they note \"Previous studies have revealed that the G-type olivine–ringwoodite transformation quickly completes when it proceeds to the critical volume fraction of 5–10 vol.% due to the positive feedback of the latent heat release (e.g., Rubie and Ross, 1994; Kirby et al., 1996; Mosenfelder et al., 2001).\"\n",
    "* The transformed volume by intracrystallion nucleation should always be bigger, since it assumes a smaller parental grain size, thus a larger nucleation area S.\n",
    "* Note the slight differences of our curves to theirs (e.g. the 250 wt.ppm H2O curve in figure 5 a, at 700 depth, theirs is around 0.85, while ours is around 0.95)"

    "       - $T$: Temperature (K).\n",
    "       - $z$: Depth (m).\n",
    "       - $\\eta_0$, reference viscosity.\n",
    "       - $T_0 = 1873.15 \\, \\text{K}$, reference temperature.\n",

    "2. **Grain Size Profiles**:\n",
    "   - Initial grain sizes:\n",
    "     - Olivine: $d_{a0} = 5 \\, \\text{mm}$.\n",
    "     - Wadleyite: $d_{b0} = 0.1 \\, \\text{mm}$.\n",
    "   - Grain size evolution is based on the transformed volume fraction $V$:\n",

    "Here, we made the simplification to omit latent heat.\n",
    "Initially, we made the transformed volume grows from 0 at all the test points.\n",
    "With different length of time elapsed, we include a color plot at a constant time (e.g. 50 Myr), contours of the transformed volume at different model time.\n",
    "The effects from the transition could be seen such that at a later time, the predicted transition forefront progressively shifts toward cooler temperatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following this analysis, we then plot contours of the site saturation timescale $t_s$ and the growth timescale $t_g$ (i.e $t_{0.5}$ assuming early site saturation). The diagram is divided into four categories based on kinetic regimes: M — metastable, G — growth-controlled kinetics, N — nucleation-controlled kinetics, and E — equilibrium transition, using the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ M: \\quad t_s > 100~\\mathrm{Ma},\\ t_g > 100~\\mathrm{Ma} $$\n",
    "$$ G: \\quad t_s \\leq t_g,\\ \\min\\left(t_s, t_g\\right) < 100~\\mathrm{Ma} $$\n",
    "$$ N: \\quad t_s > t_g,\\ \\min\\left(t_s, t_g\\right) < 100~\\mathrm{Ma} $$\n",
    "$$ E: \\quad t_s < 10~\\mathrm{kyr},\\ t_g < 10~\\mathrm{kyr} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Contours of the Avrami number equal to 1 are also plotted.\n",
    "These contours illustrate the balance between the diffusion timescale and the kinetic transition timescale.\n",
    "The two different boundary thicknesses represent the characteristic thermal diffusion length scales: 100~km for the entire lithospheric plate (black dashed line) and 5~km for the effective boundary of the metastable olivine wedge (grey dashed line).\n",

    "There are two types of process:\n",
    "* serial: this runs with just one process. It has the advantage of reporting the progress. It could be used to estimate the running speed.\n",
